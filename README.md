## Introduction

The purpose of a visual sorting algorithm project is to provide a visual representation of how different sorting algorithms operate on a set of data. 
It provides as an educational tool and to visualize the time complexity of each sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Adjustable sorting algorithms: Users can choose between Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- Customizable array size: Users can change the size of the array to observe how algorithms perform with different datasets.
- Speed control: Adjustable animation speed to observe the sorting process at various speeds.
- Play and pause animation: Users can control the animation flow for a more interactive experience.
- Generate new array: Button to generate a new random array for sorting.
- Different Sorting Algorithms like QuickSort, BubbleSort, MergeSort, etc.
